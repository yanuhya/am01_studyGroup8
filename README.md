# Final project - Ask a manager

As part of our final project we analysed the [ask a manager](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IPS5dBSGtwYVbjsfbaMCYIWnOuRmJcbequohNxCyGVw/edit?resourcekey#gid=1625408792) data, a survey in which 24000+ people participated and shared their salary and job information.

The majority of responses were received from white women in the US 

The key take aways from our analysis are:
1. There is a noticeable difference in pay for women and men and this difference is predominant in the US as compared to other countries.
2. Some industries value higher levels of education more than others. For instance, Law values higher education levels than Computing or Tech. 
3. In the US, there is a significant salary difference between respondents with a master's degree comapred to those with a bachelor degree.
4. Along the East and West coast of the US, we see that the salaries are higher than the other regions.
